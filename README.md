# Amazon_Vine_Analysis

## Overview of the analysis: Explain the purpose of this analysis.
The purpose of this project is to analyze the reviews of Amazon's Vine Program. This program is a paid program, where manufactuerers can pay to receive reviews from their products. Their products are provided to Amazon Vine members who are required to publish a review. One can only be a Vine Reviewer by invite only. Amazon considers Vine Reviewers some of the most trusted reviewers on their website. This project aims to determine if there is any bias toward favorable reviews from Vine members. 

## Results: Using bulleted lists and images of DataFrames as support, address the following questions:

### How many Vine reviews and non-Vine reviews were there?
There were a total of 43574 reviews for outdoor products. Of those 21372 reviews were 5 star ratings. Overall, there were far more reviews for paid vs. unpaid users. This makes sense because to become a Vine Reviewer, you must be selected.
